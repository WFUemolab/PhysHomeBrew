These are files created by Christian Waugh (CW) at Wake Forest University
to be used as add-ons to ANSLAB () 

Please see ANSLAB's instructions for downloading and installing it

These files are meant to be used in collaboration with CW given that people will need to be trained to use them. 
Please feel free to contact CW at waughce@wfu.edu if you use ANSLAB or if you'd like to start using ANSLAB and want additional data manipulation, calculation and gathering scripts.
